        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>My personal website will serve as an online portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. It will provide future employers and interested individuals with a comprehensive view of my work, making it easier for them to understand my qualifications and potential contributions.</p>

        <h2>Intended Audience:</h2>
        <p>The primary audience for my personal website includes potential employers, recruiters, and clients seeking web development and design services. It's also open to anyone interested in getting to know me professionally.</p>

        <h2>Rationale:</h2>
        <p>I have chosen this project as it aligns with the manageable scope of creating a three-page website within four weeks. The website will consist of a home page introducing myself and two child pages highlighting my skills and showcasing my work. Each page will have significant textual content, featuring details about my background, skills, and projects, along with relevant images. It will be hosted on GitHub and styled for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.</p>

        <p>I will be using basic HTML and CSS to ensure that the website remains simple and informative in nature. This approach allows me to effectively present my qualifications and portfolio to potential employers and clients. This project combines the technical skills we've learned with practical use in creating a portfolio that will be beneficial for my future career.</p>
